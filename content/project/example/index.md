title: This paper analyzes the effects of the 1984 breakup of the Bell System,
  the largest telecommunications company at the time, on the rate and direction
  of innovation in the U.S. The aim of the breakup was to end exclusionary
  practices that Bell allegedly used against competitors. After the breakup,
  patenting by U.S. inventors increased by 19%. This increase was concentrated
  in telecommunications technologies and was driven by existing companies. We
  also find that the diversity of innovation, in terms of different approaches
  to the same technology, increased. Our results suggest that exclusionary
  behavior can lead to "missing innovations".
