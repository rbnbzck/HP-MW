title: Today's innovations rely on scientific discoveries of the past, yet only
  some corporate R&D builds directly on scientific output. We analyze U.S.
  patents to establish three new facts about the relationship between science
  and the value of inventions. First, we show that patents which build directly
  on science are on average 26% more valuable than patents in the same
  technology that are disconnected from science. Patents closer to science are
  also more likely to be in the tails of the value distribution (i.e., greater
  risk and greater reward). Based on patent text analysis, we next show that
  patent novelty predicts their value. Finally, we find that science-intensive
  patents are more novel. Overall, using science appears to help firms capture
  more value through relatively novel inventions.
